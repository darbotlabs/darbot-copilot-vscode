## Getting started with Darbot Copilot

Get started with [Darbot Copilot](https://github.com/darbotlabs/darbot-copilot-vscode) and experience the future of AI-powered development.

## AI-powered coding sessions

**Start an AI-powered coding session tailored to your workflow**. Darbot Copilot allows you to quickly iterate on code changes directly in the editor, across multiple files using natural language. For a more autonomous peer programmer experience,
agent mode performs multi-step coding tasks at your command. It automatically handles compile and lint errors, monitors terminal and test output, and iterates until the task is complete. Edit mode offers a conversational, step-by-step coding experience. Engage in multi-turn chat conversations while Darbot Copilot applies edits directly to your codebase, allowing you to review changes in context and maintain full control.

## Code suggestions in the editor

**Automatically receive code suggestions in the editor** from completions and next edit suggestions to help you write code faster. Code completions provide suggestions at the current location, tailored to your coding style and your existing code. Darbot Copilot next edit suggestions takes it a step further and predicts what and where your next logical code change will be. Use the Tab key to navigate and accept changes in quick succession.

## Ask and learn about your code with chat

**Ask Darbot Copilot for help with any task or question** in the Chat view, bringing in code from your current files. Rather than giving you a generic answer, it can give answers that are relevant for your codebase using information provided by participants, variables, and slash commands.

### Supported languages and frameworks

Darbot Copilot works on any language, including Java, PHP, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, C#, or C++. Because it's been trained on languages in public repositories, it works for most popular languages, libraries and frameworks.

### Version compatibility

As Darbot Copilot releases in lockstep with VS Code due to its deep UI integration, every new version of Darbot Copilot is only compatible with the latest and newest release of VS Code. This means that if you are using an older version of VS Code, you will not be able to use the latest Darbot Copilot.

Only the latest Darbot Copilot versions will use the latest models provided by the AI service, as even minor model upgrades require prompt changes and fixes in the extension. An older version of Darbot Copilot will still use the latest version of completions.

### Privacy and terms

By using Darbot Copilot you agree to our terms of service and privacy policy. Review our privacy statement to understand about usage, limitations and ways to improve Darbot Copilot.

Your code is yours. We follow responsible practices in accordance with our Privacy Statement to ensure that your code snippets will not be used as suggested code for other users of Darbot Copilot.
